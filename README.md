# Black-Jack
Purpose: Desktop Java application developed to allow users to play the card game Black Jack against a bot dealer. 

Context: Project was a final project given in the course CSCI 1301 Introduction to Computing and Programming. Code for UI was provided by the course but all methods and other back end coding was personally completed. The simplest way to run this project would be on an IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse. However, it can be manually compiled and run as long as all necessary java components like JVM and jdk are installed on the machine and the path to these files are appropriately set.
